short_description: >
 The kvm-unit-tests are a set of tests which can be used to verify virtualized CPUs
 (like KVM and others), emulated CPUs (like TCG from QEMU) or even real CPU behavior.

 This test suite with -qemu suffix won't use the qemu binary provided in
 distribution, but will clone official qemu git tree and build qemu from
 source code.
